### Week 5

#### Progress during this week
There is now a class that generates rivers by creating a graph (this looks horrible, but it works) from a heightmap and running Dijkstra's algorithm on the graph. It's only in use for PN maps for now because its application needs to be adjusted a bit for DS maps.

This is pretty much the amount of features I had planned to implement at the start of the project, and from now on I will concentrate on improving the existing features and writing the remaining data structures, tests and documentation.

#### Questions
How extensive should Javadoc documentation be? Is it enough to give a concise description of a class and its more complex methods, or am I expected to have Javadoc entries for every method and its parameters?

#### Next week
Write versions of the remaining standard data structures and functions: PriorityQueue, Random and Math functions. Better test coverage and more documentation.
