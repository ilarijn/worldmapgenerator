### Week 1

#### Progress during this week
Set up the project, wrote project definition and did research on algorithms and techniques related to the subject. There are now areas to expand into beyond just using a single noise algorithm. 

#### Problems and questions
I am not sure if the algorithms I am planning to use actually need any data structures more abstract than an array, though I could make it a point of implementing e.g. a list structure somewhere where it would be helpful.

Also, it seems to me the context where the algorithms are used here might not be performance-critical to the point where it becomes an issue, so performance comparisons are not that interesting but can of course still be done.

#### Next week
Study Perlin noise, make first attempt at implementing it and rendering some kind of map from the output.
