### Week 4

#### Progress during this week
I managed to set up a working version of the diamond-square algorithm. It was an easier to algorithm to understand and the output actually looks more interesting than what is produced by the version of Perlin noise, at least for these types of maps. I think I should take a second look at the random vector generation, fade functions and parameter ranges in PN to see if they could be tweaked for better results.

#### Questions
Do I also need to implement library functions like Math.log and Random.nextDouble myself?

#### Next week
Make an attempt at generating rivers. If it looks like too much, try writing Langton's ant algorithm.
