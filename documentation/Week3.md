### Week 3

#### Progress during this week
There is now a working Perlin noise implementation that adds together one or several octaves of noise according to parameters provided by the user. The output can be viewed as a simple colored terrain map or as grayscale noise. Canvas contents can also be saved as a .png image and viewed in e.g. [Aerialod](https://ephtracy.github.io/index.html?page=aerialod#ss-carousel_ss). The latter proved to be a really nice tool for visualizing output, and I'm going to try generating river(bed)s that also look natural in this type of 3D model. 


#### Next week
I will continue by implementing [diamond-square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm) and see how it compares. After that, I will start looking at river generation. If that proves too difficult or time consuming, I will continue with Langton's ant.
