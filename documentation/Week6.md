### Week 6

#### Progress during this week
With the exception of sine and cosine, I managed to put in versions of all remaining data structures and math functions used in the core application. Implementing Mersenne Twister was a kind of a mix-and-match situation between the original source and the pseudo code representation in Wikipedia, but it seems to work okay.

I also did a bit of performance testing (compare heaps in Dijkstra) and updated the implementation and testing documents.

#### Next week
I still need to write usage instructions and more comprehensive Javadoc comments. After this, I'll write some tests to confirm algorithm time complexities. Then if time permits, I will improve river generation a bit.
